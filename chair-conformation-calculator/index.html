<p>The trick is to remember that just like the Haworth projections the chair conformations also have the well-defined up and down positions. Six hydrogen centers are poised in axial positions roughly parallel with the C 3 axis and six hydrogen atoms are located near the equator. Thus the diaxial conformation is 27. Therefore boat conformation is less stable than chair conformation. Works an example of translating a trisubstituted cyclohexane perspective d.

<p>Least stable chair Most stable chair 1 1 1 Ð18 kcalmolG b Chlorocyclohexane also exists in two different chair conformations one of which is 06 kcalmol more stable than the other ie the A value for the chloro group is 06. For most classes all you will need to know how to do is use equatorial preference to predict the most stable chair conformation. Yet one conformation is preferred over the other due to the energies associated with the substituent when positioned on the chair. Ive drawn cis-14-di-tert-butyl-cyclohexane with ChemDraw and used EditGet 3D Model and ChemBioDraw gave me the structure which is NOT the energetical most suitable one.

<p>Looks at defining total strain as the sum of angle torsional and steric strain. Therefore boat conformation is less stable than chair conformation. As we can see from the above calculations as the temperature rises the percentage contribution by equatorial conformation decreases while that by axial conformation increases.

<p>Start with a blank chair conformation. In the left-hand cyclohexane chair carbon atoms 13 and 5 are above an imaginary horizontal plane and carbon. However with so much strain on the bonds it prefers to adopt a chair conformation. Draw both chair conformation ring-flip and use the table to calculate the relative energy cost associated with each group in the axial position to determine the more stable chair conformation of each of the following compounds. There are two equivalent chair conformations. Cyclohexane Chair Conformation Stability Which One Is Lower Energy.</p>
