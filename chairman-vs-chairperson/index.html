<p>The event runs from 8 am. Chairman and its derivatives dont need an s in between because chair is often used in singular when it means office position or official seat. Both refers to the same position held by an individual. As nouns the difference between chairperson and chairman is that chairperson is a chairman or chairwoman someone who presides over a meeting board etc while chairman is a person implied male presiding over a meeting. The person in charge of a meeting or organization is referred to as the chair or sometimes the chairperson. Indra Nooyi Ceo Of Pepsi Indra Nooyi Powerful Women Woman Quotes.</p>
