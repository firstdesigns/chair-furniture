<p>The cone may break explode or fall down from the bar due to hammering. Salt and rust can also wear down your cables. If a turn has slipped off the spool most likely what has happened by the sound of it rather than the spring has become weak with age or is binding on something - its self or the frame then you need to close the door clamp the spring or spool at the loose end to stop the spool turning there is often a hole in the shaft that you can stick a screw driver or 6 nail or similar through to stop it turning and lift the door. If your door works with a garage door opener press the wall button to close the door. When the door is raised the springs unwind and the saved stress lifts the door by turning the shaft thus turning the cable drums wrapping the cables across the grooves on the cable drums.

<p>The cable youre going to be disconnecting runs around the garage doors frame above the doorway. The one on the other side of the garage door is ok though. Okay youre not literally cutting the cord just disconnecting it. Many times the cable breaks when the door is down. Keep your hand on the cable at all times and wind it neatly until you can attach the loop at the other end to the pin at the bottom of your garage door.
