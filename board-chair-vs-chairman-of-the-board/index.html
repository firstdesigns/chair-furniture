<p>To answer the question. In corporate governance and structure a President of a company holds the title of Chief Operating Officer COO. Chairman is the head of board and in nearly all cases there is also a President who is the real head of the company. She is responsible for making sure that everyone plays by the rules and must hold each board member accountable to the vast array of responsibilities they have from meeting attendance to committee service to fundraising. The title of Board Chair is probably more descriptive when the person chairs the governing body and runs the meetings but is not the chief executive officer of the organization.

<p>As discussed in Worlds In Collision Agency Law And A Directors Fiduciary Duties a director qua director is generally not an agent of the corporation and neither is the board of directors. As the leader of the board the chairman carries immense sway over the program and fundraising strategy of the nonprofit. Board chairs or all board members for that matter typically only serve a nonprofit organization for a few years. The biggest difference is that a chairman of the board promotes shareholder interests while a CEO is essentially the head of the company itself. In fact it is a best practice of nonprofit boards to bring in new people.

<p>To answer the question. However it is common for employees and shareholders of the company to use the word chairman for the person holding this post rather than calling him chairman of the board. She is responsible for making sure that everyone plays by the rules and must hold each board member accountable to the vast array of responsibilities they have from meeting attendance to committee service to fundraising. Meanwhile a CEO which is short for chief executive officer is a high-ranking executive responsible for making strategic and operational decisions that. The CEO is the top decision-maker for the company and the person who oversees the daily operations and logistics.
