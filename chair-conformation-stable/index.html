With this conformation the bond angles are 1109 degrees much closer to the ideal 1095 degrees. A second much less stable conformer is the boat conformation. Among which chair conformation is most stable because it has negligible ring strains so its potential energy is 0 kcalmol. In this con-formation of cyclohexane the carbons do not lie in a single plane. The chair conformation has alternating axial up axial down so once you have that single axial substituent move on to.</p>

Assuming that A values are additive and hence subtractive if necessary predict what the ΔG value will be. Together these features make the chair conformation very stable. The chair conformation is a six-membered ring in which atoms 2 3 5 and 6 lie in the same plane atom 1 lies above the plane and atom 4 lies below the plane. After doing so I am a little uncertain which of the conformations is the most stable. Complete Collection Organic Chemistry Study Teaching Chemistry Chemistry Lessons.</p>

<p>Notice how the axial-methyl group is thrown closely together with the axial hydrogens in carbons 3 and 5. A second much less stable conformer is the boat conformation. With this conformation the bond angles are 1109 degrees much closer to the ideal 1095 degrees. The equatorial bonds e are perpendicular to the axis of the ring while axial bonds a are parallel to the axis of the ring.
