With a ring flip all hydrogens that were originally axial become equatorial and all hydrogens that were equatorial become axial. In the chair conformation of cyclohexane all the carbons are at 1095º bond angles so no angle strain applies. With no torsional strain and no angle strain cyclohexane is the most stable of all the small rings of.

<p>However other cycloalkanes like cyclodecane for example also has a chair conformation. In it we look at the axial and equatorial placement of substituents. In this conformation the carbon-carbon ring bonds are able to assume bonding angles of 111 o which is very near the optimal tetrahedral 1095 o so angle strain has been eliminated. Three hydrogen atoms point straight up and three Hs point straight down at. At 25 C 9999 of all molecules in a cyclohexane solution adopt this conformation.

<p>Cyclohexane and the Chair Structure. If you have not already done so you should construct a model of cyclohexane now and use it to follow the subsequent discussion. Axial Equatorial posns. The absence of angle strain is a result of cyclohexanes bond angle being very close to the ideal tetrahedral bond angle of 1095 in its chair conformer. At 25 C 9999 of all molecules in a cyclohexane solution adopt this conformation.
