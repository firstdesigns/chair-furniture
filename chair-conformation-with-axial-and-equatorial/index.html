<p>Thus we can say that at 150C 888 of equatorial conformation and 112 of axial conformation exists in equilibrium. If the tert-butyl group is placed in the axial bond then the chair has the highest energy or the least stable conformation. Use the guidelines below place substituents in the proper axialequatorial orientation.

The above chair flip in the video is slightly offRemember that the direction of the groups up vs. Once youve mastered the art of drawing chair conformations its time to stick some axial and equatorial substituents on those beautiful chairs.
