<p>C-1 is easily identified because it is the hemiacetal carbon-the only carbon bonded to two oxygen atoms. Draw the chair conformation as shown below with the ring oxygen on the back right-hand corner and the hemiacetal carbon C1 down. B trans-14-Dimethylcyclohexane shown below also exists in two different chair conformations one of which is 36 kcalmol more stable than the other.</p>
<h3 id="and-there-we-have-it">And there we have it.</h3><p>Explaining how A-Values are related to cyclohexane flip energy. Thus the energy barrier for ring flipping is about 10 kcalmol in each case. An envelope conformation will have a plane of symmetry and thus be achiral. We can now move arond the exterior oxygen molecules to find in which postition equatorial or axial the glucose reaches its lowest energy level. There is however one major effect which is much stronger in tetrahydropyrans than in cyclohexanes and is induced by the presence of oxygen lone pairs which replace some C-H bonds. The chair structure of cyclohexane is considered to be the perfect conformation.</p>
