<p><strong>Chair Conformation Graph</strong>, A lot of students say Oh but theyre both equatorial so that means that they should be cis. Total Energy 65593 kcalmol. The A-value of a tert-Butyl is in the range of 5 kcalmol which is around the value of the energy difference between cyclohexane in twist-boat and chair conformation.</p>

<p>Or one is equatorial and one is. A the tert-butyl group is axial and the methyl group is equatorial in a chair conformation. The ground state conformation of cyclohexane is a fully staggered conformation which is shaped somewhat like a chair.</p>

Chair Conformation graph paper to help you spend less time drawing diagrams and more time studying. D both groups are equatorial in a chair conformation. This conformation of cyclohexane is called the chair conformation be-cause of its resemblance to a lawn chair. Best quality PDF allows for flawless printing. In this conformation there is no torsional strain at all and as we shall see later no strain of any kind.</p>
