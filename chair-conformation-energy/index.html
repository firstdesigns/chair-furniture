<p><strong>Chair Conformation Energy</strong>, In a chair conformation with a few exceptions only axial substituents will give rise to steric strain energy. The lower energy chair conformation contains one axial methyl group and one equatorial methyl group. The lower energy chair conformation contains two axial methyl groups.</p>

Solution Draw The Lowest Energy Chair Co Organic Chem From clutchprep.com</p>
<p>For most classes all you will need to know how to do is use equatorial preference to predict the most stable chair conformation. The tert-butyl group needs to be placed in the equatorial bond as it is the lowest energy or highest stability conformation. These are two different structures in which the cyclohexane molecule can exist but they have different stabilities depending on the energy.</p>
<h3 id="always-place-the-largesthighest-priority-group-in-the-equatorial-position">Always place the largesthighest priority group in the equatorial position.</h3><p>A The two chair conformations are equal in energy. This means that the chair conformation is the structure that is observable. However since this conformation is 55 kcalmol higher in energy than the chair conformation it is not a highly populated stateAgain most of the strain energy results from bonds which are eclipsed or partially eclipsed ie from torsional strain. For most classes all you will need to know how to do is use equatorial preference to predict the most stable chair conformation. The lower energy chair conformation contains two axial methyl groups. The terms chair conformation and boat conformation come under organic chemistry and they are mainly applicable to cyclohexane.</p>
