Given the fact that we have a 3rd bedroom above the garage will changing the garage doors to insulated ones make a difference in that bedroom as it can get cold in there if the door is shutand if we keep the door open it will cause our heat to run more often. Insulation can help slow down the transference of heat or cold because it presents a barrier. An insulated garage door will not make your garage door warm but it will make it warmer. If I Add Insulation To My Garage Door Do I Need To Change My Springs As Well.</p>
