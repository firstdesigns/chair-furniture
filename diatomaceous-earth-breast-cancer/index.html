<p>Diatomaceous earth offers an alternative method for detoxing your body, one that is inexpensive, simple, and effective.

Diatomaceous earth is approved for use against all of these home pests. Zeolite powder, which i use in the bath as well as internally, is expensive. Beware Food additives, Nutrition labels, Reading food labels.</p>
