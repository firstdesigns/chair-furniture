<p>If you are looking for Drawing chair conformations from wedge and dash youve come to the right place. Level three is recognizing cis and trans on a cyclohexane ring and understanding that up substituents can be equatorial as well as axial. So while a wedge is always drawn as up in the chair conformation in the book you can just turn the page upside down and it is now down but obviously still the same molecule.</p>

Chair conformation is 3D as drawn on paper. The chair conformation has alternating axial up axial down so once you have that single axial substituent move on to. Next we have to visualize the cyclohexane ring in the chair conformation. Chemistry questions and answers. All cyclohexanes have two chair conformations.</p>
