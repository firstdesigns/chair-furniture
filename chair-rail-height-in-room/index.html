The standard chair rail height recommendation is about one-third the height of the wall but various factors come into play that may affect the height you choose. I really prefer to see the chair rail at the sill height but 24 in an 8 room is too low. The chair rail is weak.

<p>The chair rail is weak. There is a rail behind the toilet at 30 even with countertop. Now it depends more on the height of the room. About 28 to 32 inches is an optimum range for chair rail height says Hull. Meaning that for a room with a ceiling height of eight feet the chair rail would be no higher than 32 inches from the floor.

<p>Consider complete panelling below the chair rail. Plan to paint walls and woodwork white two different shades. For me a good rule of thumb is to install chair rail molding at 25 of the height of the room. You can see that measurement falls just above the high point of the chair rail in our dining room. Considering the look you want the height of the room and the existing architectural features can help you choose the right height.
