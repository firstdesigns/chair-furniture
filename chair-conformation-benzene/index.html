Benzene is a planar structure. The chair conformation has alternating axial up axial down so once you have that single axial substituent move on to. So the 13-diaxial notation is the most common way we refer to the gauche interactions of axial groups in the chair conformations. Identify the up tip OR down tip of your chair conformation and draw a straight line up up tip or down down tip parallel to the y-plane.

<p>The chair conformation of cyclohexane is not rigid. In the trans-isomer both may be equatorial. Of cyclohexane occupy coplanar positions and when carbon atoms 3 and 6 are on opposite sides of the aircraft conformation from the D3d symmetry group is called a form of chair. It is important to remember that the bonds on a given side of a chair ring-conformation always alternate in this fashion. Due to this reason chair conformation is stable than boat conformation. 3 3 Conformations Of Cyclic Organic Molecules Chemistry Libretexts.</p>

<p>The idea that the chair conformation is the most stable structure for cyclohexane was first proposed as early as 1890 by Hermann Sachse but only gained widespread acceptance much later. Therefore it should be clear that for cis-12-disubstitution one of the substituents must be equatorial and the other axial. Apart from the number of hydrogen atoms benzene has a planar structure and cyclohexane has a chair confirmation.
