<p>Calculating Flip Energy. So for a if we draw our chair weLL start with that. In the previous two posts we have talked about drawing the ring-flip of chair conformations and the A value 13-diaxial interactionsAnd we learned that for a given cyclohexane the axial conformer is less stable than the corresponding equatorial conformerFor example the energy difference of the axial and equatorial isopropyl cyclohexane is 92 kJmol. Most of the time the structure exists in what is called the chair conformation. While orgo is NOT an art class if your substituents are ambiguous you may lose points.
