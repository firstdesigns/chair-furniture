<p>Calculating Flip Energy. So for a if we draw our chair weLL start with that. In the previous two posts we have talked about drawing the ring-flip of chair conformations and the A value 13-diaxial interactionsAnd we learned that for a given cyclohexane the axial conformer is less stable than the corresponding equatorial conformerFor example the energy difference of the axial and equatorial isopropyl cyclohexane is 92 kJmol. Most of the time the structure exists in what is called the chair conformation. While orgo is NOT an art class if your substituents are ambiguous you may lose points.

<p>Here we have a model of the cyclohexane molecule and it looks like its a flat hexagon from this perspective but it isnt really if we turn it to the side we can see this is not a planar molecule this is called the chair conformation of cyclohexane and if we stare down these two carbons well be able to see the chair conformation from a Newman projection viewpoint so now you can see that we have staggered hydrogens here we have a picture of the chair.
