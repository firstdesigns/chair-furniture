To put the focus on your chest during dips start by using bars that place your hands outside of shoulder width. Dont lock the elbows on top - Stop just a little bit before full lock out. Slow down the reps - try counting as you go down 5 seconds up 3 seconds. The problem is that if i wait to do dips until later in the routine im not strong enough to do very many.
