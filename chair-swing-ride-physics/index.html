<p>Suppose the total mass of a chair and its occupant is 204 kg. These rides which spin around like a carousel have swings hanging down from the top that people sit in. B Find the speed of the chair. What Forces Do You Experience Feeling On This Ride. Like that next time you are riding one you will find a a lot better understanding of just how the ride is defined together and why it really is a whole lot fun to ride.

<p>Now well start like we do with most of our problems by drawing a free body diag. Developed in the early 1800s by Franz Schwarzkopf the fairground ride is a variation of the carousel in which chairs are suspended by chains from the rotating top of a carousel. Here weve defined both the tension and the lost E for a seat on a swing ride. Lets discuss the physics of flying chair swing rides a little bit more so you understand how it operates. Suppose the total mass of a chair and its occupant is 179 mathrmkg a Determine the tension in the cable attached to the chair.
