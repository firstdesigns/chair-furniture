We call that user-centred. The engineering team was asked to design and manufacture a reconfigurable obstetrics. Explain that they will be designing a chair and building prototypes of the chair following the steps of the engineering design process as they work. Yet many people today spend most of their time sitting in front of their desks and computers on poorly engineered chairs. An ergonomic chair design and engineering is therefore considered very important for its usability and comfort point of views for the students.</p>
