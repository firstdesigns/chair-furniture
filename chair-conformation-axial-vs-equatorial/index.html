<p>In the previous two posts we have talked about drawing the ring-flip of chair conformations and the A value 13-diaxial interactionsAnd we learned that for a given cyclohexane the axial conformer is less stable than the corresponding equatorial conformerFor example the energy difference of the axial and equatorial isopropyl cyclohexane is 92 kJmol. Which chair conformation is lowest in energy. If axial is up equatorial is down if equatorial is up then axial is down.</p>
<h3 id="the-above-chair-flip-in-the-video-is-slightly-off">The above chair flip in the video is slightly off.</h3><p>The lower energy chair conformation contains one axial methyl group and one equatorial methyl group. Axial positions are perpendicular to the plane of the ring and equatorial positions are around the plane of the ring. Note that in the conformation where methyl is axial there is a gauche interaction between the axial methyl group and C-3. Chair conformation of cyclohexane is more stable than boat form because in chair conformaion the C-H bonds are equally axial and equatorial ie out of twelve C-H bonds six are axial and six are equatorial and each carbon has one axial and one equatorial C-H bond. If axial is up equatorial is down if equatorial is up then axial is down. Down should not change when going from axial to equatorial or vice versa.</p>

<p>All the math is still correct here but I should have drawn the groups down instead of up on the second chair. The key difference between axial and equatorial position is that axial bonds are vertical while equatorial bonds are horizontal. Lets say if A-value is 73 kJmol for the methyl group then the equatorial methylcyclohexane is more stable by 73kJmol than the axial methylcyclohexane. That means notice this one right here.

<p>The lower energy chair conformation contains two axial methyl groups. Every carbon on the chair conformation has 1 substituent axial and the other equatorial. Chair conformation of cyclohexane is more stable than boat form because in chair conformaion the C-H bonds are equally axial and equatorial ie out of twelve C-H bonds six are axial and six are equatorial and each carbon has one axial and one equatorial C-H bond. 22 21. Down should not change when going from axial to equatorial or vice versa.

<p>Down should not change when going from axial to equatorial or vice versa. These six hydrogens which point along an axis through the molecule are called axial. The higher energy chair conformation contains two axial methyl groups. Lets say if A-value is 73 kJmol for the methyl group then the equatorial methylcyclohexane is more stable by 73kJmol than the axial methylcyclohexane. Every carbon on the chair conformation has 1 substituent axial and the other equatorial. 2 Mistakes With Chair Conformations And How To Avoid Them Organic Chemistry Chair Axial.</p>
