<p>I have a Wayne Dalton garage door and the bracket ripped from the door yesterday morning. Most garage doors have between 10 and 12 rollers and if any come off the track you can spot them with a quick visual inspection. Kind of surprising since the door bracket was hanging from a single screw. Your best bet to preventing this from happening is to use in addition to the nut and washer usually used to affix the bracket to the door a carriage bolt which goes all the way through to either side of the door thus keeping the bracket extra secure. If they are stuck and sliding this can cause the door to come off its tracks. Garage Door Opener Hanging Brackets Garage Door Opener Garage Doors Open Ceiling.</p>
