<p>Rolling office chairs can be easily converted to stationary chairs by replacing the caster with chair glides. These glides install inside the metal cup on the bottom of chair or table feet and are commonly used in wrought iron patio sets. Simply peel and stick. Rubber-base glides do not slide as easily as other swivel glides with nylon steel or felt bases they are recommended for VCT flooring concrete and hardwood applications where it is desirable for chairs combos tablet arms and student desks to slide as little as possible. Use on any surface including carpeting ceramic tile concrete decks linoleum and wood floors.

Rubber-base glides do not slide as easily as other swivel glides with nylon steel or felt bases they are recommended for VCT flooring concrete and hardwood applications where it is desirable for chairs combos tablet arms and student desks to slide as little as possible.
