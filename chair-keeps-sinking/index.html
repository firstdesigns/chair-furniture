<p>There are several reasons why your office chair keeps sinking. The gas cylinder mechanism of office chairs is built comparatively. Since I like to keep the chair at the highest position I decided I would make a slight adjustment to the Lockable Gas Spring that holds the chair at the set position. DIY is usually not recommended as installing a new pneumatic cylinder can be a tedious task. This will fill in as your security from the gas that may be exhausted by the cylinder.

<p>This will fill in as your security from the gas that may be exhausted by the cylinder. This is a spring that has been filled with air. Before attempting to disassemble your chair you have to wear eye goggles first. Although it looks nearly new and is in great shape the chair sinks and wont stay up. One of the more common DIY quick fix or hack is to use a hose clamp and some duct tape. Camilla Swivel Desk Chair Anthropologie Pink Office Chair Bedroom Desk Chair Swivel Chair Desk.</p>
