            <p>Answer 1 of 3. Problem 47 Easy Difficulty. chair conformation in cyclohexane is.</p>
<p><strong>Chair Conformation In Cyclohexane Is</strong>, The equatorial bonds e are perpendicular to the axis of the ring while axial bonds a are parallel to the axis of the ring. The stability is a consequence of no angle strain owing to the almost tetrahedral C-C-C bond angles and no torsional strain due to the perfectly staggered. The axial positions point perpendicular to the plane of the ring whereas the equatorial positions are around the plane of the ring.</p>

<p>The lowest energy form is the most important. Conformation of cyclohexane contains centre of symmetry is A Chair B Boat C Half chair D Twist boat. The chair structure of cyclohexane is considered to be the perfect conformation.</p>
<h3 id="the-equatorial-bonds-e-are-perpendicular-to-the-axis-of-the-ring-while-axial-bonds-a-are-parallel-to-the-axis-of-the-ring">The equatorial bonds e are perpendicular to the axis of the ring while axial bonds a are parallel to the axis of the ring.</h3><p>Chair conformation is the most stable structure of cyclohexane. This leads to a staggered conformation in chair form reducing torsional strain. The chair structure consists of a six-membered ring where every C-C bond exists in a staggered conformation. This conformation is called the chair because it looks sort of like a reclining lounge chair as shown here. The chair conformation is the most stable conformer. D Twisting the boat to the skew boat conformation moves the flagpole H atoms away from each other and reduces the eclipsing strain.</p>
