<p>Neighbor asked me to install chair rail. If you like them go for it. Another option would be to case the window in with wood and and have the chair rail end at the edge of the casing -. However if existing windows arent as low as the chair rail needs to be thats fine. Moldings should help unify the space and this is a great way to do it.

<p>The sharp lines contrast the curved window while still making each detail look strong. Chair rail and window casing are two completely different moldings. I am wondering if it will look bad or would it look better to trim all the windows. In new construction it is ideal for windows to be sized such that the lower edges can be in line with chair rail.
