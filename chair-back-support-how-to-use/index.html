<p>Not all chairs will allow you to adjust the height of the backrest. Use a lumbar support on a high-back chair with arm rests so you can rest your elbows comfortably at angle 90 degrees. Then sit as far back as possible in the chair so that the lumbar support fills your lower back curve. So that an additional relieve can support your back. If you are going to have a seat like that for a pretty long time bring a small stool. Pin On Chairs.</p>
