<p>One of the basic pieces of furniture a chair is a type of seatIts primary features are two pieces of a durable material attached as back and seat to one another at a 90 or slightly greater angle with usually the four corners of the horizontal seat attached in turn to four legsor other parts of the seats underside attached to three legs or to a shaft about which a four-arm turnstile. The Chairless Chair has the potential to be applied to any industry that requires the workers to stand for long periods but where a conventional chair would be an impediment. When sitting the weight is led directly into the ground therefore relieving the legs and the lower back. Created by Studio Sapetti the exo-skeletal chairless chair is designed for manufacturing environment to support workers that to stand for extended periods. Noonee calls their device a Chairless Chair because it is a wearable exoskeleton that can support various positions The devices frame is constructed of aluminum and carbon fiber.
