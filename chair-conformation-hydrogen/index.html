<p>Notice how the axial-methyl group is thrown closely together with the axial hydrogens in carbons 3 and 5. Even if you are explicitly given the 2-D cyclohexane you should convert it into the 3-D chair prior to solving the E2 reaction. The total strain in the chair conformation is small and.</p>

The chair conformation is the most stable conformer. When a model of a cyclohexane in a chair conformation is placed on a table note that it is standing on three of the axial hydrogens flip the model over to have it stand on the other three axial hydrogens. Look at the axial-methylcyclohexane in chair conformation shown. When dealing with E2 reactions using cyclohexane you must draw the chair conformation to see if there are any neighboring anti-periplanar hydrogens.

<p>Notice how the axial-methyl group is thrown closely together with the axial hydrogens in carbons 3 and 5. A second much less stable conformer is the boat conformation. The definition of chair conformation is the lowest energy conformation for cyclohexane in which all bond angles are fairly close to 1095 and all hydrogen atoms are staggered. Transcribed image text.

<p>In this process the equa-torial hydrogens have become axial and the axial hydrogens have become equatorial. Entirely strain-free conformation called the chair conformation in which all bond angles are perfectly tetrahedral and all bonds to hydrogen are perfectly staggered. When viewed along any carboncarbon bond viewing the structure from an end Fig2 the bonds are seen to be perfectly staggered. The dihedral angle between two hydrogen atoms on adjacent carbon atoms on the same side of the ring is 55º.

<p>The dihedral angle between two hydrogen atoms on adjacent carbon atoms on the same side of the ring is 55º. All carbon centers are equivalent. This means that the chair conformation is the structure that is observable. The chair conformation is considered to be the lowest energy conformation because it lacks both angle strain and torsional strain. The key difference between chair and boat conformation is that chair conformation has low energy whereas boat conformation has high energy.

<p>The chair conformation is the most stable conformation of cyclohexane. Half of the hydrogens are in the plane of the ring equatorial while the other half are perpendicular to the plane axial. Six hydrogen centers are poised in axial positions roughly parallel with the C 3 axis and six hydrogen atoms are located near the equator.

<p>This means that the chair conformation is the structure that is observable. The hydrogens which radiate out from around the ring are called equatorial hydrogens. The chair conformation is the most stable conformation of cyclohexane. Transcribed image text. These H atoms are respectively referred to as axial.

<p>Look at the axial-methylcyclohexane in chair conformation shown. The equatorial bonds alternate from slightly up to slightly down in their orientation from one carbon to the next. In each of the conformations drawn in step 4 circle the axial substituents other than hydrogen. These H atoms are respectively referred to as axial. Therefore to reduce torsional strain cyclohexane adopts a three-dimensional structure known as the chair conformation. 4 6 Axial And Equatorial Bonds In Cyclohexane Chemistry Libretexts.</p>
